Complete the user journey based on what you know so far.\"), AIMessage(content=\"# System Design Document\\n\\n## Design Objectives:\\n\\nThe main objectives of the stock recommendation system design are:\\n\\n1. Provide users with accurate and personalized stock recommendations based on a combination of factors.\\n2. Ensure the system is performant, responding to user requests within 10 seconds and handling a target of 1,000 query requests per second (QPS) for ranking queries.\\n3. Implement robust security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.\\n4. Design the system to scale horizontally without significant effort under heavy load.\\n\\n## Background:\\n\\nThe need for the stock recommendation system arises from the increasing demand for personalized investment advice based on various factors. Traditional stock analysis methods can be time-consuming and may not consider all relevant factors. The system aims to automate the process and provide users with accurate and timely stock recommendations.\\n\\n## Overview:\\n\\nThe stock recommendation system is a web-based application that allows users to receive personalized stock recommendations based on a combination of factors. The system will rank stocks based on the specified factors and present the results to the user. The system will have a user interface (UI) for user interaction, an API for data retrieval and processing, and a backend for data storage and analysis.\\n\\n## Requirements:\\n\\n### Functional Requirements:\\n\\n1. Users should be able to input the desired date for stock ranking.\\n2. Users should be able to select the factors and their weights for stock ranking.\\n3. The system should retrieve the necessary data for stock ranking, including historical stock prices and factor values.\\n4. The system should process the ranking algorithm to determine the stock rankings based on the selected factors and weights.\\n5. The system should present the ranked stocks to the user, along with relevant information such as stock symbols, company names, and factor values.\\n6. Users should be able to filter and customize the displayed stock rankings based on additional criteria.\\n\\n#### Representative User Journey:\\n\\nA representative user journey for getting the top 20 stocks based on Market Cap, PEG, and 20-day Momentum, excluding stocks with a market cap under 100 million, can be described as follows:\\n\\n1. The user accesses the stock recommendation system and is presented with the user interface.\\n2. The user selects the desired date for stock ranking.\\n3. The user chooses the factors for stock ranking, namely Market Cap, PEG, and 20-day Momentum.\\n4. The user assigns weights to each factor based on their preferences.\\n5. The user specifies the minimum market cap threshold as 100 million.\\n6. The user submits the request for stock ranking.\\n7. The system retrieves the historical stock prices and factor values for the specified date.\\n8. The system applies the ranking algorithm, considering the selected factors and weights, to determine the stock rankings.\\n9. The system filters out stocks with a market cap under 100 million.\\n10. The system presents the top 20 ranked stocks to the user, including relevant information such as stock symbols, company names, and factor values.\\n\\n### Non-Functional Requirements:\\n\\n1. Performance:\\n   - The system should respond to user requests within 10 seconds.\\n   - The ranking queries should handle a target of 1,000 query requests per second (QPS) in the first stage.\\n2.
