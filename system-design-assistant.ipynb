    "### Stock Ranking System Design Document\n",
    "#### Design Objectives:\n",
    "Help investors select stocks based on the ranked factor values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background:\n",
    "We believe that there is a huge market for investment education products. Thus, we want to design a stock recommendation system for individual investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview:\n",
    "The Stock Ranking System will provide investors with a sorted table of stocks based on factor values. Users will be able to select the date for which they want the factor data. The system will utilize point-in-time data to ensure accuracy and reliability. The ranking will be calculated using a weighted sum of factor values if multiple factors are present. Data for the system will be ingested from another source.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "- **Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "  - The system should rank stocks based on factor values.\n",
    "  - Users should be able to select the date for which they want to see the factor data.\n",
    "  - The system should handle multiple factors by using a weighted sum to rank the stocks. Supported factors include Market Value, Close Price, PE, ROE, PB, and BP.\n",
    "  - Users can customize the weight of each factor but equal weights will be assumed if not provided.\n",
    "  - Users can filter stock universe based on market cap and other criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Representative User-Journey:**\n",
    "  - A user wants to get the top 20 stocks based on the Market Cap, PEG, and 20-day Momentum. The user wants to exclude stocks with a market cap under 100 million.\n",
    "    1. The user accesses the system's UI and navigates to the stock ranking feature.\n",
    "    2. The user selects the date for the factor data.\n",
    "    3. The user selects Market Cap, PEG, and 20-day Momentum as the factors.\n",
    "    4. The user inputs the market cap filter value of 100 million.\n",
    "    5. The user clicks the \"Get Rankings\" button.\n",
    "    6. The system processes the request and returns a sorted list of the top 20 stocks meeting the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "  - **Performance:**\n",
    "    - The system should respond within 10 seconds.\n",
    "    - Handle around 1,000 query requests per second (QPS) with data for 8,000 companies and 2 to 150 combined factors.\n",
    "  - **Security:**\n",
    "    - Avoid common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.\n",
    "  - **Scalability:**\n",
    "    - Scale horizontally without too much effort under heavy load.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Architecture:\n",
    "1. **Programming Language Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **Python:**\n",
    "     - Pros: Simple syntax, large community, extensive libraries for data processing and machine learning.\n",
    "     - Cons: Slower performance compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "   - **Java:**\n",
    "     - Pros: Strong performance, multi-threading capabilities, robust ecosystem.\n",
    "     - Cons: Verbose syntax, steeper learning curve.\n",
    "   - **Go:**\n",
    "     - Pros: High performance, simplicity in concurrent programming, efficient.\n",
    "     - Cons: Limited libraries and community compared to Python, less mature in data processing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Layers:**\n",
    "   - **API Layer:** Handles incoming requests and responses.\n",
    "   - **Application Service Layer:** Contains business logic and orchestrates different components.\n",
    "   - **Domain Layer:** Contains domain-specific logic and entities.\n",
    "   - **Infrastructure Layer:** Manages data persistence and external system interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monolithic Architecture:** The system can be a single deployable unit for ease of development and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Frontend Frameworks Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **Vue 3:**\n",
    "     - Pros: Simple learning curve, strong community support, extensive plugin ecosystem.\n",
    "     - Cons: Relative newcomer compared to React, Angular.\n",
    "   - **Svelte:**\n",
    "     - Pros: Great performance, lean and concise code, less boilerplate.\n",
    "     - Cons: Smaller community, less mature ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Database Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **PostgreSQL:** Strong relational database with powerful querying capabilities, ACID compliance.\n",
    "   - **MySQL:** Reliable, common in web applications, ACID compliance.\n",
    "   - **Clickhouse:** Columnar database optimized for read-heavy operations, suitable for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Recommended Database:**\n",
    "   - **PostgreSQL:** This database is recommended due to its balanced performance, extensive support for complex queries, and robustness in maintaining data integrity. Its ACID compliance ensures reliable transactions, making it a strong candidate for handling point-in-time data and complex stock ranking algorithms. The horizontal scalability features provided by PostgreSQL also align with the scalability requirements.\n",
